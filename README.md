# Automated-Traffic-Light-Control
This project develops a traffic light management system using a Moore finite state machine (FSM) with counters to control delay timing. It manages yellow, red, and green light sequences at intersections in a logical, safe, and efficient manner to improve traffic flow and safety.
## Prohect Description 
This project focuses on the design and implementation of a traffic light management system using a Moore finite state machine (FSM) combined with counters to regulate delay timing. 
The system is built to manage the sequencing of traffic lights - red, yellow, and green in a logical and reliable manner. 
By leveraging the FSM model, the transitions between states are precisely defined, ensuring that the timing of each signal is consistent and predictable. 
The integration of counters allows for flexible control over delay durations, making the system adaptable to real-world traffic conditions. 
The goal of this project is to enhance traffic management by providing a safe, efficient, and structured light sequence at intersections. 
This implementation demonstrates the practical use of digital design concepts in solving real-life problems.
